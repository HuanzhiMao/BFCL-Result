The backend would handle the Python function calls and the frontend would handle user interaction and display. Here's a basic outline of the steps:\n\n1. **Backend**: You would need a server-side language to handle the Python function calls. You could use a framework like Flask or Django in Python for this. This backend would expose APIs for the frontend to interact with.\n\n2. **Frontend**: You could use JavaScript, along with a framework like React or Angular, to build the user interface. The frontend would send requests to the backend APIs to run the Python function, and then display the results.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how this might work:\n\n1. A user interacts with the frontend interface by rating products on your e-commerce website.\n2. These ratings are sent to the backend server as a request to an API.\n3. The backend server receives the request, converts the ratings into a format that the Python function can use (like a pandas DataFrame), and then calls the Python function with the appropriate parameters.\n4. The Python function returns a recommendation model, which the backend server sends back to the frontend interface as a response to the API request.\n5.

This is usually in the center of the room, but it can be offset for a more unique look.\n\n2. Determine the Height: Cathedral ceilings are typically at least 1.5 times the height of a standard 8-foot ceiling. However, the height can vary based on the overall size of the room and your personal preference.\n\n3. Design the Arch: The arch of a cathedral ceiling can be either simple or complex. A simple arch is a semi-circle, while a complex arch might include multiple curves or angles.\n\n4. Consider Lighting and Ventilation: High ceilings can make a room feel cooler and darker. You might want to consider adding skylights, additional windows, or strategic lighting to brighten up the space and make it feel more inviting.\n\n5.

The game is played with a deck of 108 cards. There are four colors (red, yellow, green, blue), and each color has cards numbered 0-9, along with three special action cards: Skip, Reverse, and Draw Two. Additionally, there are four Wild cards and four Wild Draw Four cards.\n\n2. Each player starts with seven cards. The remaining cards form a draw pile, and the top card is turned over to begin a discard pile.\n\n3. The player to the dealer's left starts the game. On your turn, you must match a card from your hand to the card on the top of the discard pile, either by number, color, or symbol.\n\n4. Special action cards have the following effects: Skip - the next player is \"skipped\"; Reverse - changes the direction of play; Draw Two - the next player must draw two cards and lose their turn.\n\n5. Wild cards can be played on any card and allow the player to nominate any color to continue play. The Wild Draw Four card forces the next player to draw four cards and also allows the player to nominate any color to continue play. However, you can only play this card if you do not have a legal card to play (i.e., a card that matches the color or number of the current top card).\n\n6. If you don't have a playable card, you must draw from the draw pile. If the draw pile is empty, the discard pile is reshuffled to form a new draw pile.\n\n7. The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner of that round. Points are scored for the cards left in each player's hand, with special action cards scoring higher.\n\n8. The game can be played to a certain score (like 500), or until a player reaches a certain number of rounds won.\n\nAgain, I can't execute or interpret Python code, but the function you provided seems to be for shuffling a deck of cards.
