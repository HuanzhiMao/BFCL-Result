Lion mating involves the following key points:\n\n- Lions are polygynous, meaning males mate with multiple females. A pride typically consists of 1-2 adult males, several adult females, and their offspring.\n\n- When a female lion is in estrus (heat), the male will stay with her, mating multiple times over the course of several days. Mating occurs about every 15-20 minutes, with up to 50 copulations per 24 hours.\n\n- Gestation lasts around 110 days, after which the female gives birth to a litter of 1-4 cubs, usually in a secluded den. \n\n- The mating male may provide some protection for the cubs, but the majority of parental care comes from the mother and other females in the pride.\n\nSo in summary, lion mating involves a male consorting with a receptive female and copulating multiple times to induce ovulation, with the goal of fathering the next generation of cubs that are then cared for communally by the females.

The farad unit of capacitance is named after him.\n\nSo while electricity itself was not \"discovered\", these individuals and others in the 1700s and 1800s were pivotal in developing our early understanding of electrical phenomena and inventing ways to harness its power, ushering in the electric age.", "input_token_count": 601, "output_token_count": 278, "latency": 15.723601818084717}

Typical angles range from 45-65 degrees.\n\n- The height and volume created by cathedral ceilings can make a space feel open and airy. Consider the proportions of the room and desired atmosphere. \n\n- Exposed structural beams or trusses are commonly incorporated for decorative emphasis and visual interest. Timbers are often stained or left natural.\n\n- For an authentic look, beams should be rough-hewn and sized appropriately to look structural even if they are just aesthetic.\n\n- If using exposed beams, consider acoustics, as the hard surfaces can reflect sound. Incorporating some softer, sound-absorbing materials helps manage echoes.\n\n- Windows are often placed in gable ends to bring in natural light and accentuate the height. Dormer windows are another option.\n\n- Lighting should be selected and placed to highlight the ceiling's architecture. Up-lighting between beams creates dramatic shadows.\n\n- Select materials like wood planking that emphasize the natural beauty and rustic charm that complement cathedral ceilings.\n\nThe key is balancing proportions, visual interest through exposed structural elements, natural materials, and well-placed lighting to take full advantage of the dramatic ceiling height and angles.

Have your piano tuned regularly by a professional piano technician, usually twice per year. This keeps the piano sounding its best.\n\n3.

Keep drinks and plants off the piano to avoid spills and water damage. The wood is very sensitive to liquids.\n\n5. Play your piano regularly. Playing keeps the mechanical parts moving freely and prevents sticking keys and other issues that can arise from disuse.\n\n6. Have your piano serviced by a technician every few years to regulate the touch and make adjustments as the mechanical parts settle over time.\n\nThe main things are providing a stable environment, having it tuned regularly, keeping it clean, and playing it often.
