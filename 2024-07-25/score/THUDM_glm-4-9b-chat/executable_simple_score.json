Also, this code does not handle the edge cases where the number of collinear points is extremely large or when there are horizontal or vertical lines. For a robust solution, you would need to handle these cases appropriately.\n\nIf you don't have an API endpoint to call right now, you can use the `maxPoints` function in the code snippet as a stand-in to calculate the maximum number of points that fall on the same line for your given set of points."}
