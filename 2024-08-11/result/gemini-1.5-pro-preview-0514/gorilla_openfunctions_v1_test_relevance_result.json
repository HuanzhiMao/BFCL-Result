Try to keep your piano in a room with consistent temperature and humidity levels.\n* **Cleaning:** Dust and debris can build up on the piano's surface and inside the mechanism. Regularly dust the piano's exterior, and use a soft cloth to clean the keys. \n* **Professional Servicing:**  It's a good idea to have your piano professionally serviced every few years. A technician can address any issues and ensure that your piano is in top condition. \n"], "input_token_count": 74, "output_token_count": 154, "latency": 3.653498888015747}
