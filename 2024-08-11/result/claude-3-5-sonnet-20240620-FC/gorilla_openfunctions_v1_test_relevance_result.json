Gameplay: \n   - Players take turns playing a card from their hand that matches either the number or color of the top card on the discard pile.\n   - If a player can't play a card, they must draw a card from the draw pile.\n   - Special action cards include Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, and Wild Draw Four.\n\n4. Special cards:\n   - Skip: Next player misses a turn\n   - Reverse: Reverses direction of play\n   - Draw Two: Next player draws two cards and misses a turn\n   - Wild: Player chooses the next color to be played\n   - Wild Draw Four: Like Wild, but next player also draws four cards and misses a turn\n\n5. Calling \"Uno\": When a player has only one card left, they must call \"Uno\" before the next player takes their turn. If they don't and are caught, they must draw two cards.\n\n6. Winning: The first player to play all their cards wins the round. Points are scored based on the cards left in other players' hands.\n\nThese are the basic rules, but there can be variations depending on house rules or specific editions of the game.\n\nIf you'd like to know about shuffling an Uno deck, I could use the provided function to demonstrate that.
