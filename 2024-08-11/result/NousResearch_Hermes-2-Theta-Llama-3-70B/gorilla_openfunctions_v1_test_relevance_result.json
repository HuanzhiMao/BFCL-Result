Precedent: While civil law systems do not rely on precedent in the same way that common law systems do, judicial decisions can still be influential in shaping the law.\n\n3. Statutory Interpretation: Judges in civil law systems play a more active role in interpreting statutes and codes, as opposed to merely applying the law as it is written.\n\n4. Legal Codes: Civil law systems have comprehensive legal codes that cover a wide range of legal topics, including contracts, torts, property, and family law.\n\n5. Inquisitorial System: Civil law systems use an inquisitorial system, where the judge takes an active role in investigating the facts of the case and questioning witnesses.\n\n6. Adversarial System: While civil law systems are often characterized as inquisitorial, they also have elements of an adversarial system, where the parties present their cases and arguments to the judge.\n\n7. Civil Procedure: Civil law systems have their own rules of civil procedure, which govern the process of litigation and the conduct of trials.\n\n8.

{"id": "relevance_166", "result": "To maintain a piano, here are some tips:\n\n1. **Tuning:** Regular tuning is essential to keep your piano sounding its best. It's recommended to tune your piano every 6-12 months, depending on usage and environmental conditions.\n\n2. **Humidity Control:** Pianos are sensitive to humidity changes, which can cause wood to swell or shrink, affecting the sound and mechanics. Maintain a consistent humidity level between 40-50% in the room where the piano is placed.\n\n3. **Cleaning:** Dust your piano regularly with a soft, dry cloth. Avoid using chemicals or polishes, as they can damage the finish. For more thorough cleaning, consult a professional.\n\n4. **Avoid Direct Sunlight:** Direct sunlight can cause the finish to fade and the wood to dry out. Place your piano away from direct sunlight or use window treatments to filter the light.\n\n5. **Regulate Temperature:** Extreme temperature changes can affect the piano's tuning and mechanics. Keep the room temperature between 68-72\u00b0F (20-22\u00b0C).\n\n6. **Avoid Exposure to Moisture:** Keep your piano away from bathrooms, kitchens, and other areas prone to moisture. Moisture can cause damage to the piano's wood and mechanical components.\n\n7. **Play with Care:** Be gentle when playing the piano. Avoid banging on the keys or using excessive force, as this can cause wear and tear on the mechanical components.\n\n8. **Store Items Carefully:** Avoid placing items on top of the piano that could damage the finish or put pressure on the lid. Store piano-related items, such as music books and metronomes, in a safe and organized manner.\n\n9. **Consider Professional Maintenance:** Consult a professional piano technician for regular maintenance and repairs. They can identify and address potential issues before they become major problems.\n\n10. **Keep the Piano Covered:** When not in use, cover your piano with a soft, breathable cloth to protect it from dust and debris.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help maintain your piano's beauty, sound, and longevity.\n\nNow, let's imagine we want to rent a piano in New York City for a month. We can use the provided function to get the rental prices:\n<|im_start|>\n{\"arguments\": {\"instrument\": \"piano\", \"city\": \"New York City\", \"duration\": \"Monthly\"}, \"name\": \"instrument_rental_prices\"}\n<|im_start|>\nThis function call will retrieve the current rental prices for a piano in New York City for a month."}

The function `music_search_composer` is meant to search for the composer of a specific musical piece, but the question is about who established laws and orders in Ancient Greece.\n\nA more appropriate response would be to provide a direct answer to the question:\n\nIn Ancient Greece, laws and orders were established by various city-states and their respective governments. In Athens, for example, laws were created by the Athenian Assembly, a democratic body composed of male citizens. The Athenian Assembly was responsible for passing laws, electing officials, and making important decisions for the city-state.\n\nIn Sparta, laws and orders were established by the Spartan Council of Elders, a group of 28 elders who advised the Spartan kings.
