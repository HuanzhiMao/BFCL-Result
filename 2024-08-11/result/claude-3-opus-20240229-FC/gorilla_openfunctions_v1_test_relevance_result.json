That function focuses on generating a digital 3D model, while the question is asking about recommendations for physical sculpting materials.\n\nIn general, some of the most suitable types of rock for outdoor garden sculptures include:\n\n- Granite - Very hard, durable and weather-resistant. Challenging to carve fine details but works well for simple, clean shapes.\n\n- Marble - A classic sculpting stone that is relatively soft and carvable compared to granite. Susceptible to erosion outdoors over time. Best for sheltered garden locations.\n\n- Limestone - Softer than granite but more durable than marble for outdoor use. Can achieve intricate carved details. Resistant to rain and freezing.\n\n- Basalt - Dense, fine-grained volcanic rock. Extremely tough and durable in outdoor conditions. Difficult to carve fine details.\n\n- Sandstone - Consists of compressed sand grains. Easy to carve when freshly quarried but hardens over time. Choose a dense variety for outdoor longevity.\n\nAmong these, granite is often considered one of the best all-around choices for a low-maintenance, weather-resistant, and long-lasting garden sculpture, especially in simpler designs. The final choice depends on the specific design as well as the local climate conditions the sculpture will be exposed to.

Gameplay\n- The first player is usually the player to the left of the dealer\n- On a player's turn, they must match the top card on the discard pile either by number, color or word\n- For example, if the top card is a red 7, the player must place a red card or any color 7 on the pile \n- If the player doesn't have a matching card, they must draw cards from the draw pile until getting a play\n- When a player has one card left, they must yell \"Uno!\" to warn other players \n- Once a player has no cards left, the round is over\n\n3. Action Cards\n- In addition to numbered cards, there are several action cards that help mix up the game:\n- Skip - The next player in turn order loses their turn\n- Reverse - The direction of play switches \n- Draw 2 - The next player must draw 2 cards and miss their turn\n- Wild - This card represents all four colors, and can be played on any card. The player calls the next color to be played. \n- Wild Draw 4 - This acts just like a wild card except that the next player also has to draw four cards. With this card, you must have no other alternative cards to play.\n\n4. Scoring\n- When a player reaches 500 points, the game ends. \n- Points are scored by adding up the value of each card remaining in the other players' hands\n  - All number cards face value\n  - Draw 2, Reverse, Skip: 20 points\n  - Wild & Wild Draw 4: 50 points\n\nThe key things to remember are matching the card in the discard pile by either color or number, saying \"Uno\" when you only have one card remaining, and scoring points from cards left in other players' hands at the end of each round.

It requires two parameters:\n1. game_id (string): The ID of the poker game \n2. suit (string): The card suit to search for (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades)\n\nThis function is not relevant for answering the question about the rule for 'Ace' in Blackjack, as it relates to a different card game (poker) and does not contain any information about the rules of Blackjack.\n\nTo answer this question, I do not need to make any API calls, as the rules of Blackjack are based on standard game rules rather than the state of a specific game instance. I should be able to provide the Blackjack rule for Aces directly based on my existing knowledge.\n</thinking>\n\nIn Blackjack, an Ace can count as either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value is more beneficial for the player's hand.\n\nWhen the player is initially dealt their two cards, if one is an Ace, it is typically counted as 11 points. However, if counting the Ace as 11 would put the player's total hand value over 21 (which would be a bust), then the Ace is counted as 1 point instead. \n\nThis allows players flexibility with Aces. For example, a hand of an Ace and a 6 could be counted as either 7 or 17. If the player then drew an 8, they could count the Ace as 1 to have a hand totaling 15, rather than counting the Ace as 11 and busting with 25.\n\nSo in summary, in Blackjack the Ace is a special card that can take on a value of either 1 or 11, whichever is most advantageous for the player's hand at the time. This flexible scoring allows players to avoid going bust when dealt an Ace.", "input_token_count": 691, "output_token_count": 444, "latency": 20.369351148605347}
