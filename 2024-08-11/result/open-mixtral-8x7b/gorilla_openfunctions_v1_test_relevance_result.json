To get the current time in a specific city, you would typically use a library or API that provides real-time timezone information, such as the `pytz` library in Python or a timezone API like the one provided by Google Cloud.\n\nHowever, if you had access to a function that could convert a city name to its corresponding timezone, you could use the `datetime` module in Python to get the current time in that timezone. Here's an example of how you might do that:\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timezone\n\n# Assume get_timezone_for_city is a function that takes a city name as input and returns its corresponding timezone\ntimezone_for_nyc = get_timezone_for_city('New York City')\n\n# Get the current time in the desired timezone\ncurrent_time_in_nyc = datetime.now(timezone_for_nyc)\n\n# Print the current time in 12-hour format\nprint(current_time_in_nyc.strftime('%I:%M %p'))\n```\nThis code assumes that you have a function called `get_timezone_for_city` that can take a city name as input and return its corresponding timezone. If you don't have access to such a function, you would need to find a way to obtain timezone information for a given city before you could get the current time there.", "input_token_count": 379, "output_token_count": 344, "latency": 3.629215955734253}
