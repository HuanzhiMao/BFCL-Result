However, the provided function calculates the probability of an event. To answer this question using the provided function, we need to find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads (which is 1 outcome), then multiply it by the total number of possible outcomes for tossing 3 coins (which is 8) to get the expected number of heads.\n\nThe probability of getting exactly 3 heads when tossing 3 coins is (1/2)^3 = 0.125. Since the return format of the probability\\_calculator function is a percentage by default, we need to set the return\\_decimal parameter to True to get the result in decimal format.\n\nTherefore, the function call to get the expected number of heads is probability\\_calculator(total\\_outcomes=8, event\\_outcomes=1, return\\_decimal=True) \\* 8. However, since the question asks for the number of heads, we need to multiply the result by 3 to get the number of heads instead of the expected number of events. Hence, the final function call is [probability\\_calculator(total\\_outcomes=8, event\\_outcomes=3, return\\_decimal=True) \\* 3].\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the coins are fair and that the outcome of each toss is independent of the others.", "input_token_count": 361, "output_token_count": 353, "latency": 8.478641033172607}
