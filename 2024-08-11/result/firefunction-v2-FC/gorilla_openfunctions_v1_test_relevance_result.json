This can be measured by metrics such as survival rate, resource gathering efficiency, or combat effectiveness.\n4. **Apply Evolutionary Algorithm**: Use the Evolutionary Algorithm to evolve the creatures over generations. This involves selecting fittest individuals for reproduction, applying crossover and mutation operators to generate new offspring, and replacing the least fit individuals with the new offspring.\n5. **Repeat and Refine**: Repeat steps 3-4 for multiple generations, refining the fitness evaluation function and adjusting parameters as needed.\n\nBy applying the Evolutionary Algorithm in game AI, you can create creatures that adapt to changing environments, learn from their experiences, and evolve to become more effective players.\n\nNow that you have a basic understanding of how to apply Evolutionary Algorithm in game AI, let's discuss how to fine-tune it for your specific use case.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about implementing Evolutionary Algorithm in game AI?", "input_token_count": 499, "output_token_count": 309, "latency": 3.312044858932495}

To play a card, it must match the color or symbol of the top card on the discard pile. If a player has no cards that match, they must draw a card from the draw pile.\n6. There are several special cards in Uno:\n   - Reverse: Switches the direction of play.\n   - Skip: The next player in line is skipped and play passes to the next player.\n   - Take Two: Forces the next player to draw two cards from the draw pile and skip their turn.\n   - Wild: Can be played on any color and allows the player to change the color of play to any color they choose.\n   - Wild Draw Four: Combination of Wild and Take Two; allows the player to change the color and forces the next player to draw four cards from the draw pile and skip their turn.\n7. If a player has only one card left in their hand, they must say \"Uno\" before playing their last card. If they fail to do so and are caught by another player, they must draw two cards from the draw pile as a penalty.\n8. The game continues until one player has played all their cards.
