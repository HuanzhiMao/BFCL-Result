The mating process in Lions is polygynous, meaning that one dominant male mates with multiple females in the pride.\n\nWhen a female Lion is in heat, she will often leave her pride and roam in search of a mate. She will advertise her receptiveness to mating by vocalizing and leaving scent marks on trees and rocks. Males in the area will pick up on these signals and approach the female.\n\nThe dominant male in the pride will typically mate with the female, but other males may also attempt to mate with her. If a male from outside the pride is successful in mating with the female, he may take over the pride and become the new dominant male.\n\nAfter mating, the female Lion will become pregnant and give birth to a litter of cubs, usually 2-6 in number. The cubs will be born blind and helpless, but will develop quickly under the care of their mother and the rest of the pride.\n\nI hope this information is helpful! Let me know if you have any further questions.", "decoded_result": [{"get_genetic_traits": {"species": "Lions", "dominant_trait": "Mane color", "recessive_trait": "Mane length"}}]}
