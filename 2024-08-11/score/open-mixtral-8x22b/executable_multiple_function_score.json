As there's no information about the exact daily changes in temperature, we'll assume that the temperature increased linearly from the minimum to the maximum over the month, which is not explicitly stated in the problem. However, this assumption allows us to calculate the average based on the provided information.\n\nThe function \"calculate_mean\" requires a list of numbers as a parameter, and in this case, we're providing the minimum and maximum temperatures as the only input. This function will then return the average of these two values.\n\nNote: If the exact daily temperature changes were provided or if there was another way to determine the total sum of temperatures for the month, a more precise average could be calculated."}
