On your turn, you must match a card from your hand to the top card of the discard pile, either by number, color, or symbol.\n3. If you don't have a playable card, you must draw a card from the draw pile. If that card can be played, you may do so. Otherwise, play moves to the next player.\n4. There are special cards in 'Uno' that can change the course of the game. These include Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, and Wild Draw Four cards.\n5. When you have only one card left, you must say \"Uno\" to indicate this. If you don't and another player catches you before the next player begins their turn, you must draw two cards.\n6. The game continues until one player gets rid of all their cards. Points are then scored (if playing multiple rounds) and a new game begins.\n\nRemember, these are just the basic rules.

Slowly bring the water to a rolling boil over medium heat.\n4. Once the water is boiling, let the eggs cook for the optimal time calculated by the function.\n5. After the cooking time has elapsed, immediately drain the hot water and transfer the eggs to a bowl filled with ice water.\n6. Allow the eggs to cool in the ice water for at least 10 minutes before peeling.\n\nEnjoy your perfectly boiled egg!", "input_token_count": 204, "output_token_count": 329, "latency": 7.442922830581665}
