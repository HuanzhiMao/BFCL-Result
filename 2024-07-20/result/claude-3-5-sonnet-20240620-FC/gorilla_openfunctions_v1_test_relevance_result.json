Ancient distribution: Fossil evidence suggests that ancient panda species once had a much wider distribution across Asia and even into Europe.\n\n5. Speciation: The giant panda and the red panda, despite both being called \"pandas,\" are not closely related. Their similar adaptations for eating bamboo are an example of convergent evolution.\n\n6.

This number is often referred to as the \"Shannon number,\" named after Claude Shannon, who first calculated an estimate.\n\nThe generally accepted estimate for the number of possible legal positions in chess is around 10^43 (1 followed by 43 zeros).

The objective is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards. Here are the basic rules:\n\n1. Each player starts with 7 cards.\n\n2. The remaining cards are placed face down to form a draw pile.\n\n3. The top card of the draw pile is turned over to begin a discard pile.\n\n4. Players take turns placing a card from their hand onto the discard pile.\n\n5. You can only play a card that matches the top card of the discard pile in either number or color, or you can play a Wild card.\n\n6. If you can't play a card, you must draw a card from the draw pile. If you can play this card, you may do so immediately.\n\n7. Special action cards include:\n   - Skip: Next player misses their turn\n   - Reverse: Reverses direction of play\n   - Draw Two: Next player draws two cards and misses their turn\n   - Wild: Player chooses the next color to be matched\n   - Wild Draw Four: Player chooses the next color, and next player draws four cards and misses their turn\n\n8. When you have only one card left, you must yell \"UNO!\"\n\n9. The game ends when a player has no cards left. Points are scored based on the cards left in opponents' hands.\n\nThese are the basic rules, but there can be variations in house rules or official tournament play. \n\nIf you'd like to simulate shuffling a deck of Uno cards using the provided function, I could help you with that.

It can be worth 1 point, or\n2. It can be worth 11 points\n\nThe value of the Ace is typically chosen to be whichever is most advantageous for the player's hand. This flexibility is what makes the Ace a powerful card in Blackjack.\n\nFor example:\n- If you have an Ace and a 6, you can count it as 7 (1+6) or 17 (11+6).\n- If you have an Ace, a 5, and a 10, you would count the Ace as 1 to avoid going over 21 (1+5+10 = 16).\n\nThis rule is often referred to as a \"soft\" hand when an Ace is counted as 11 because you can't bust (go over 21) by taking another card.\n\nIs there anything specific about the Ace rule in Blackjack you'd like to know more about?
