The function `get_primary_triads` takes a single argument, the root note of the key. It returns a list containing the primary triads in the given key as strings.\n\nSince this is not a tool call, this is not the format you're looking for. However, if you want to load a file and extract the primary triads from it using the provided function, you can modify the code as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom music21 import converter\n\ndef get_primary_triads(key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the primary triads (I, IV, and V) in the given key.\n    \"\"\"\n    root = note.Name(key)\n    chord_prog = [chord.Chord(root), chord.Chord(chord.addMinorSeventh(root)), chord.Chord(chord.addMajorSeventh(root))]\n    return [str(chord.rootnote(chord)) for chord in chord_prog]\n\n# Use the following line to load a MIDI or MusicXML file\n# Set the file path to the desired file\nscore = converter.parse('file.mid') or converter.parse('file.xml')\n\n# Set the key signature of the file\n# Set the root note to C in this example\nroot_note = note.Name('C')\nkey_signature = score.getElementsByClass('KeySignature')[0]\nkey = key_signature.getAttributes()[0].value\nkey = note.Name(key)\n\n# Get the primary triads in the key of the loaded file\nprimary_triads = get_primary_triads(key)\n\nprint(primary_triads)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `get_primary_triads` function to extract the primary triads from the given key, which is extracted from the loaded file. You can call this function with the following format:\n\n```python\nget_primary_triads(note.Name('C'))\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\nkey = note.Name('C')\nget_primary_triads(key)\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\nkey = note.Name(score.getElementsByClass('KeySignature')[0].getAttributes()[0].value)\nget_primary_triads(key)\n```\n\nIf you want to load a file and extract its primary triads using the provided function, you can modify it as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom music21 import converter, corpus, note\n\ndef get_primary_triads(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the primary triads (I, IV, and V) in the key of a given MIDI or MusicXML file.\n    \"\"\"\n    score = converter.parse(file_path)\n    root_note = note.Name(score.getElementsByClass('KeySignature')[0].getAttributes()[0].value)\n    key = note.Name(root_note)\n    chord_prog = [chord.Chord(root), chord.Chord(chord.addMinorSeventh(root)), chord.Chord(chord.addMajorSeventh(root))]\n    return [str(chord.rootnote(chord)) for chord in chord_prog]\n\n# Use the following line to extract the primary triads from a file\n# Set the file path to the desired file\nprimary_triads = get_primary_triads('file.mid') or get_primary_triads('file.xml')\n\nprint(primary_triads)\n```\n\nThis function takes a file path as an argument and uses it to load the file and extract its primary triads. You can call this function with the following format:\n\n```python\nget_primary_triads('file.mid')\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\nget_primary_triads('file.xml')\n```", "input_token_count": 327, "output_token_count": 1290, "latency": 21.988521814346313}
