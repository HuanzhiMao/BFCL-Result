William Gilbert (1544-1603) - An English physician who is credited with coining the term \"electricity\" from the Greek word \"elektron\" meaning amber. He differentiated between electricity and magnetism.\n\n3. Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) - An American polymath who conducted extensive experiments with electricity in the 18th century. He demonstrated that lightning is a form of electricity and invented the lightning rod.\n\n4. Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) - An Italian physicist who in 1800 invented the first electric battery, called the Voltaic pile, which produced a steady electric current.\n\n5. Michael Faraday (1791-1867) - An English scientist who made major contributions to the understanding of electromagnetism and electrochemistry.

Provide a more detailed explanation based on my own knowledge of Blackjack.\n\nSince the provided tool is not suitable, let me try to explain the 'Ace' rules in Blackjack:\n\nIn Blackjack, the Ace is a very versatile card. It can be counted as either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value is more beneficial to the player's hand. \n\nThe key 'Ace' rules in Blackjack are:\n\n1. If counting the Ace as 11 would make the player's hand exceed 21, the Ace is counted as 1 instead.\n2. A hand with an Ace that can be counted as 11 is called a 'soft' hand, because the player cannot bust by taking another card.\n3. If the player is dealt an Ace and a card with a value of 10 (a Jack, Queen, or King), this is called a 'blackjack' - the best possible starting hand in the game. Blackjack typically pays out at 3:2 odds.\n\nSo in summary, the Ace is a very valuable card in Blackjack due to its flexibility in being counted as 1 or 11 points. This helps players build strong hands without going over 21.", "input_token_count": 418, "output_token_count": 412, "latency": 4.848401069641113}
