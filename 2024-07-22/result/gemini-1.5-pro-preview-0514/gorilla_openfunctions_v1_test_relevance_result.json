Regularly dust the piano's surfaces and clean the keys.\n* **Control humidity:**  Pianos are sensitive to changes in humidity. Aim for a stable humidity level between 40-60%.\n* **Avoid direct sunlight:** Prolonged exposure to sunlight can damage the piano's finish and cause it to warp.\n* **Professional servicing:**  Consider having the piano professionally serviced every few years for a thorough inspection and maintenance. \n"], "input_token_count": 71, "output_token_count": 156, "latency": 4.0001490116119385}
